INTRODUCTION

An overall uptrend in data production has modernized the requirement to derive an extraordinary data activity analysis feedback for purposes of wide-ranging applications, from the money transfer industry to system monitoring. The project named "Efficient Data Stream Anomaly Detection" is about coming up with a Python-based solution to detect unusual patterns in the continuous data streams. Anomalies, which are termed as outliers in common parlance can signify very important events such as cheating operations, false routes, or system faults. Detecting such anomalies in real-time is pivotal to rendering quick responses and ensuring the truth and safety of the managed systems. The main purpose of this project is to create a powerful and reliable outlining of an algorithm. It will be able to adjust its settings properly to a new data model. The use case includes the imitation of rate with some abnormal data, a cyclic sector, and a hectic shear, thereby, it produces a concise test of the highlighted detection mechanism. This project stands for immediate and easy to understand the delivery of the data stream and the found anomalies with the help of the visual tool. On the other hand, consistency in the final product will be the implementation of high real-time speed as well as precision, and the most up-to-date concepts will be documented
